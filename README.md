# Docker Bratislava Talks

You can reach us 

* on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/docker.bratislava/) 
* or [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bratislava/).

## Talks

If you'd like to give a talk to our motley crew of Docker admins / developers / users / lovers / newbies / explorers, we'd love to hear your proposal!

We're trying something different and using GitHub Issues for talk submissions. This way people can ask questions, give feedback and +1 their favourites. If your talk isn't scheduled for the next meetup, leave the issue open and we may invite you to give it in the future (based on theme or time constraints)

After each meetup, we (or the speaker) will update issues with slides, links, and other useful information.

## Things to think about

Have a read through [this slide deck](http://www.slideshare.net/LookAtMySlides/codeware). It's a very good overview of how to design a good slidedeck for a technical presentation.
